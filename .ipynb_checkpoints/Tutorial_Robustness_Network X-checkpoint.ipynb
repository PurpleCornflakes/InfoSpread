    "# Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks occur in many natural and man-made systems, including Financial Systems, Computer Systems (like the WWW and the Internet), Biological Systems (the brain, protein networks, etc.) and Social Systems (e.g., contact networks). Understanding something about the robustness of these networks, in the case of when nodes or edges are removed, is important if we want to engineer or protect these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading please refer to Chapter 8 of the free Barabási E-book (http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/content/book_chapter_8.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will recreate the experiments of Albert, Jeong and Barabási. You can see the paper at http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6794/full/406378a0.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyse a number of artificial and real world networks in terms of their robustness to *failures* and *attacks*. We define a *failure* in a network as the *random* removal of a node (and its connected edges), whereas an *attack* is when we specifically remove targeted nodes (and their connected edges) based on some measure (e.g., max degree, max betweenness, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacks (or failures) are made one-by-one to the network until we remove a fraction $f$ of all the nodes $N$ in the original network. We then measure a number of network parameters to gauge their impact as a function of $f$: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. $S_c$, fraction of remaining nodes in the largest component\n",
    "2. $<l>_c$, average path length of largest component\n",
    "3. $D_c$, Diameter of the largest component \n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct these experiments on a number of networks, Barabási-Albert (BA) networks, Erdös-Réyni (ER) networks and the airline network from the previous exercise. Of course, in the case of the artificial networks we will want to repeat the analysis for many parameters and many instanes of the networks, so this may require significant computation. For reference see the figure below, also from Barabási. These graphs show the robustness of BA (scale-free) and ER networks, the top two graphs show $S$ the fraction of nodes in the giant component as a function of removals, circles are attacks and squares are failures. The lower two figures show average path length $<l>$ as a function of removals. The left hand graphs show ER networks and the right hand graphs show BA networks.\n",

    "<img src=\"robustness.png\"width=\"600\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Robustness, good or bad?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally you might think of more robustness networks as a good thing. However, sometimes we would like networks to be less robust, or figure out the best way to make the network fail. A good example of this is when you are deciding who to vacinate against a particular disease given a social contact network. A vacination is effectively the removal of a specific node in the contact network as this person cannot get or transmit the disease to others. If you're very careful, and very lucky, you might be able to break the network apart by strategically attacking (vacinating) only a few nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airport networks are crucial for understanding the spread of world-wide pandemics. Air-travel is one of the quickest ways that diseases can spread across the globe. For the airport network, an attack is effectively the closure of an airport. In that case we want to find out if it's possible to break the network apart, and stop the disease spread, by only attacking a few nodes (closing a few airports).\n",
